# Real-Estate-Website
Our team is going to create a website that is devoted to real estate services.
The website is going to contain a header, nav bar, section, and a footer.
We are going to use two fonts, one for the title and a universal one.
We found some images to help create a more appealing and interactive section in the website.
The following icons will be used:
- Facebook.
- Twitter.
- LinkedIn.
