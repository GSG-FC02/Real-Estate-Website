## our website
Our team is going to create a website that is devoted to real estate services.
The website is going to contain a header, nav bar, section, and a footer.
We are going to use two fonts, one for the title and a universal one.
We found some images to help create a more appealing and interactive section in the website, We also focused on creating an easy-to-use webpage, so the user won't need to figure it out first.

## Our Journey :
### Day-1  **designing  :fire:**
We tried to keep the design simple and cute at the same time, so we came up with this, we used some kind of illustration designs images, And we matched images and colors together, so you can feel comfortable with it.

### Day-2  **Make it real :muscle:**
At this point, we divided the work, and each one of us created an " issue " for what he will do and assigned it to himself, And started working on it.
of course, whenever we got into a problem we tried to figurer it out first, and then asked for help.
#### A problem: actually working with Github at first was kind of hard but We got used to it, Mistakes made us educated :sunglasses: .

### Day-3 
At this point, most of our work was coding or working on github.
